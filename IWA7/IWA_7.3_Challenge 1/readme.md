# IWA_7.3: Challenge 1
## The following code is meant to add the following three values together and log 10. However, it currently logs 343 instead. Please correct the mistake, and explain why 343 was logged initially:

``` js

const value = "3"
console.log(value + 4 + value)
```

### why was the code outputting 343 instead of 10
* incorrect concatination? setting the constant as a string instead of a integer/value
